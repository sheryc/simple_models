# simple_models
Logistic Regression, MLP, GRU implementations using pure numpy.

## Logistic Regression
Run a logistic regression on Breast Cancer dataset from scipy.

## MLP (WIP)
Run a MLP(simple ANN) on MNIST. Still have some bugs on loss function (and maybe calculation of derivatives). Reference: [meetvora's MLP classifier](https://github.com/meetvora/mlp-classifier)

## GRU
Run an RNN(GRU) to predict upcoming texts according to a series of given text. /dataset folder contains a shortened and simplified chaper of Charlotte Bronte's *Jane Eyre*. Reference: [erikvplas's RNN for generating pseudo-latins.](https://github.com/erikvdplas/gru-rnn)
